h3. Getting into Rools

A good starting point is studying the "rools.rb":../examples/rools.rb example.

The next step would be to browse the unit tests. They show all the aspects of the inference engine.

If you get lost in the terminology, you can consult the "glossary":glossary.html


h3. Running the Unit Tests

<em>Note :</em> Rools is developed and tested on MacOSX (<em>ruby 1.8.5 (2006-12-25 patchlevel 12) [i686-darwin8.8.3]</em>, this environment was built following the fine instructions from Dan Benjamin at "Hivelogic":http://hivelogic.com/narrative/articles/ruby-rails-mongrel-mysql-osx)

Following the Rake tradition, you can run the unit tests from your openwfe-ruby tree with

<pre>
    rake test
</pre>

You can run tests one at a time with 

<pre>

    rake test TEST=test/facts.rb

</pre>

h3. Running the Specification Tests

Rools is using "RSpec":http://rspec.rubyforge.org/
You need to install the rspec gem on your system with a few others such as "rcov":http://rubyforge.org/projects/rcov/

You can run specification tests with 
<pre>
    rake spec
</pre>

or if you want full coverage analysis with:
<pre>
    rake rcov
</pre>
This will generate the "coverage report":./output/coverage/index.html and the "specifcation report":./output/rspec_report.html
